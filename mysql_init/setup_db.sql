# nb utf8mb4 is a 'better' choice of unicode, but it consumes 4 bytes
# this can cause problems with unique keys. I think you can get around
# that with this http://stackoverflow.com/a/8747703/164611
#
# note also that collations sometimes cause equality of seemingly
# distinct characters. e.g. 'Ã„'='A'. It appears that
# utf8mb4_bin compares 'binarily' and is very persnickety, not
# matching those chars.
# but utf8mb4_general_ci will match those...

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `IMDB`
	DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
	DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
